# Day 4:
<h3>Problem Statement1 :</h3>

Write a program to determine the length of a ladder required to reach a given height when leaned against a house. 
The height and angle of the ladder are given as inputs.
<li> Note: The angle must be in radians. </li>


<h3>Problem Statement2 :</h3>

The math library contains a function that computes the square root of numbers. 
In this exercise, I need to write <b>my own algorithm for computing square roots</b>. One way to solve this problem is to use a guess-and -check approach. First guess what the square root might be, and then see how close the guess is. 
<br/>
Write a program that implements Newton's method. The program should prompt the user for the value to find the square root of (x) and
the number of times to improve the guess.
