# Day 3:
Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5- 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + ... 
<br/>The program should prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the sum of the first n terms of this series. 
<b>Have your program subtract the approximation from the value of math. pi to see how accurate it is.</b>
