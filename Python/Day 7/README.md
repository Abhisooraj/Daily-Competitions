# Problem Statement
<ol>
  <li>Write a program that computes the fuel efficiency of a multi-leg journey. The program will first prompt for the starting odometer reading and then get information about a series of legs. For each leg, the user enters the current odometer reading and the amount of gas used (separated by a space). The user signals the end of the trip with a blank line. The program should print out the miles per gallon achieved on each leg and the total MPG for the trip.</li>
  <br/>
    <li> Modify the program to get the input from a file.</li>
</ol>
