# Python üêç:

Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming 
language. Created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> and first released in <b>1991</b>.
<br/>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with it's notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

<h3> Problem 04: </h3>
<li>Day_3</li>
Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5- 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + ...
The program should prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the sum of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the approximation from the value of math. pi to see how accurate it is.

<h3> Problem 07: </h3>
<li>Day_4</li>
The math library contains a function that computes the square root of numbers. In this exercise, I need to write my own algorithm for computing square roots. One way to solve this problem is to use a guess-and -check approach. First guess what the square root might be, and then see how close the guess is.
<br/>
Write a program that implements Newton's method. The program should prompt the user for the value to find the square root of (x) and the number of times to improve the guess.

<h3> Problem 08: </h3> 
<li>Day_5</li>
Many companies pay time-and-a-half for any hours worked above 40 in a given week. Write a program to input the number of hours worked and the hourly rate and calculate the total wages for the week.

<h3> Problem 09: </h3> 
<li>Day_6</li>
Write a program that uses a while loop to determine how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. The input will be an annualized interest rate, and the output is the number of years it takes an investment to double. Note: The amount of the initial investment does not matter; you can use $1.

<h3> Problem 10: </h3> 
<li>Day_7</li>
Write a program that computes the fuel efficiency of a multi-leg journey. The program will first prompt for the starting odometer reading and then get information about a series of legs. For each leg, the user enters the current odometer reading and the amount of gas used (separated by a space). The user signals the end of the trip with a blank line. The program should print out the miles per gallon achieved on each leg and the total MPG for the trip
