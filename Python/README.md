# Python üêç:

Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming 
language. Created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> and first released in <b>1991</b>.
<br/>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with it's notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

<h3> Problem 01: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>

<h3> Problem 02: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>
The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound plus the cost of shipping. Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed cost for overhead.
Write a program that calculates the cost of an order.

<h3> Problem 03: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>
Write a program that determines the distance to a lightning strike based on the time elapsed between the flash and the sound of thunder. The speed of sound is approximately 1100 ft/ sec and 1 mile is 5280 ft.

<h3> Problem 04: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>
Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5- 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + ...
The program should prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the sum of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the approximation from the value of math. pi to see how accurate it is.

<h3> Problem 05: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>
The Gregorian epact is the number of days between January 1st and the previous new moon. This value is used to figure out the date of Easter.Write a program that prompts the user for a 4-digit year and then outputs the value of the epact.

<h3> Problem 07: </h3><b>Python</b><br/>
The math library contains a function that computes the square root of numbers. In this exercise, I need to write my own algorithm for computing square roots. One way to solve this problem is to use a guess-and -check approach. First guess what the square root might be, and then see how close the guess is.
Write a program that implements Newton's method. The program should prompt the user for the value to find the square root of (x) and the number of times to improve the guess.
